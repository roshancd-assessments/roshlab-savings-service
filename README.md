## Savings Service API
This is the initial project skeleton for the Savings Service API, created for a technical assessment. This README covers the foundational setup of the project, which was generated using Spring Initializr.

The project is built with Gradle and configured to use Java 21, ready for the implementation of the core API logic.

## Technologies Used
* **Spring Boot 3.5.4**: The primary framework for building the API.

* **Java 21**: The JDK version used for the project.

* **Gradle**: The build automation tool.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To build and run this project, you will need **JDK 21** installed on your system.

### Build

Use the Gradle Wrapper to build the project. This command will compile the code and run the default tests (which should be skipped or configured to use an in-memory database at this stage).

`./gradlew build`

## Next Steps
* The project is now ready for the implementation of the core API functionality as outlined in the assignment brief, including:

* Creating data models for the savings account.

* Defining API endpoints for creating and retrieving accounts.

* Connecting the application to a PostgreSQL database.

* Implementing request body validation.
